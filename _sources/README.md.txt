# 1. Introduction

`texgit` is a preprocessor for accessing files from `git` repositories from LaTeX.
This Python package works in conjunction with the [`texgit` LaTeX style](http://github.com/thomasWeise/texgit_tex/).
Basically, the LaTeX package fills the `aux` file of a TeX project with repository file loading request.
This Python package here then parses the `aux` file, loads the requests, then performs the request, and adds commands with the resulting file paths and URLs to the `aux` file.
In the second pdfLaTeX compilation, these then become available.


# 2. Installation

In order to use this package and to, e.g., run the example codes, you need to first install it using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or some other tool that can install packages from [PyPi](https://pypi.org).
You can install the newest version of this library from PyPi using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) by doing

```shell
pip install texgit
```

This will install the latest official release of our package as well as [all dependencies](./requirements_txt.html).
If you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released), you can do

```shell
pip install repository+https://github.com/thomasWeise/texgit_py.git
```

If you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released) and you have set up a private/public key for GitHub, you can also do:

```shell
git clone ssh://git@github.com/thomasWeise/texgit_py
pip install texgit_py
```

This may sometimes work better if you are having trouble reaching GitHub via `https` or `http`.

You can also clone the repository and then run a [`make` build](./Makefile.html), which will automatically install all dependencies, run all the tests, and then install the package on your system, too.
This will work only on Linux, though.
It also installs the [dependencies for building](./requirements-dev_txt.html), which include, e.g., those for unit testing and static analysis.
If this build completes successful, you can be sure that [`texgit`](./) will work properly on your machine.

All dependencies for using and running `texgit` are listed at [here](./requirements_txt.html).
The additional dependencies for a [full `make` build](./Makefile.html), including unit tests, static analysis, and the generation of documentation are listed [here](./requirements-dev_txt.html).
