# Dependencies Required to Use `texgit`
#
# In this file we list all the libraries that are required to use `texgit`.
# You must install them before using `texgit`.
# If you install `texgit` via pip, i.e., do `pip install texgit`, then this
# is done automatically for you. Otherwise, you could do
# `pip install --no-input --timeout 360 --retries 100 -r requirements.txt`
# with a text file `requirements.txt` that has the exact same contents as this
# file here.
#
# `texgit` is available at https://thomasweise.github.io/texgit_py.

#
# Below, we list each required library and specify the reason why it is
# needed. Notice that these libraries may, in turn, depend on other libraries.
# We cannot maintain a full list of these recursive dependencies.
# Here we only list the top-level dependencies that are actually used by
# `texgit` directly.
#

# pycommons provides lots of utilities
pycommons == 0.8.67

# strip-hints is a tool for removing type hints
strip-hints == 0.1.13

# yapf is a python code formatter
